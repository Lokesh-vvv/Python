#Complex Datatye This is specific to the python language not available in other programming language which is
#Used for the scintific calculation and stats clculas algebra and other technologies where maths required like ML al data science


#Complex numbers are having two positions which are (a+bj) [a] position is real part + second part [bj] is the imaginary part

c=10+20j #In this 10 is the real and 20j is the imaginary part and in maths we have the i2 i square its values is -1 like the way in python we have j2 j square whcih value is -1

print(c.real)
print(c.imag)


# j2 = -1 =>

print(c)

#NOTE: in the in the complex data type both the real and imaginary numbers are decimal or float numbers but the real number can be represented using the decimal,fload,binary,octal,hexadecimal all of these are
#defined for real but for the imaginary number we must not define these base value number like ninary , octal,hexadecimal

c=5+10j
print(c)

c= 5+10.5j
print(c)



c= 20.4+50j
print(c)



#Using binary

c=0b0101+20j
print(c)


#using Octal

c=0o2635+48.9j
print(c)

#using Hexa

c=0x56352789+56j
print(c)
