#String data type: The sequence of characters are called strings in other languages like java we have the strings and char but in python we have only one data type which is string

#In the python we can use the single ,double and triple quotes to define strings

#Most of the people use the single quotes to define strings for the simpliysity sake and easy redability

#But there are few cases where we have to use the double and triple quotes


#Single quotes
s= 'Durga classes are very simple'
print(s)

#Double quotes
s= "Durga classes super simple"
print(s)



s = "durga 'python' classes are super"
print(s)
#viseversa
s = 'durga python is "danger" '
print(s)



#triple quotes we have to use these when we have multiple lines of strings and there is normal strings inside the string or symbol or we have docstrings


#1) multiline strings

s= """ durga

       classes
       are
       simple"""
print(s)


#2)normal string inside the string or symbol

s= """ 'Durga' classes of "Python"
 are very simple """

print(s)

#3) We can use the triple quotes for docstring as well.
